Hi my name is Bryna Budiman. I previously studied law for both my bachelors and masters. Now I am studying a graduate degree in counselling whilst doing my creative art and storytelling business called Tatt Tale. I am learning here in Harvard DCE to be able to make a simple website for my business.
